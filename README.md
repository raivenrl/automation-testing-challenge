# QA Automation Test using Playwright
An automated end-to-end test for https://www.saucedemo.com/ 

It tests user authentication with various credentials and verifies login success or failure.


* Automated login tests for multiple username types
* Assertions to check successful and unsuccessful login attempts
* Test reporting with Playwright

## Technologies Used

* Node.js 
* Playwright 
* Cucumber.js

## Issues Encountered:

* Locked Out User: The “locked_out_user” account failed to log in as expected.
* Performance Issue: The “performance_glitch_user” experienced noticeable delays.

These issues were not fixed intentionally, as the purpose of this challenge was to test and report findings.
